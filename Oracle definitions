In Oracle Database, the **"notable network" wait class** is not a standard, officially named wait class. However, you may be referring to **"Network"** wait class or **"Other"** wait class where network-related waits may sometimes appear, especially in performance monitoring tools like **AWR (Automatic Workload Repository)** or **ASH (Active Session History)**.

### Possible Interpretations:

#### 1. **Network Wait Class**

Oracle has a **"Network"** wait class, and it includes waits related to communication between:

* Oracle client and server
* Oracle RAC instances
* Oracle processes (e.g., listener, dispatcher)

**Common Wait Events in this Class:**

* `SQL*Net message from client` – Idle wait; client is taking time to send a request.
* `SQL*Net message to client` – Time spent sending data back to the client.
* `SQL*Net more data from client` – Reading additional data from client.
* `SQL*Net more data to client` – Writing additional data to client.
* `gc current block 2-way` – In RAC, network waits for block transfer between nodes.

#### 2. **"Notable" Network Waits in Performance Tuning**

If someone says "notable network wait class," they might mean:

* **Network waits that are abnormally high** and **impact performance**.
* Waits that **exceed typical baselines**, often worth investigating.

These can show up in AWR reports under sections like:

* **Top Timed Events**
* **Wait Classes with High DB Time**

### What to Look For:

When troubleshooting network waits:

* Check **latency** and **bandwidth** between database and client/RAC nodes.
* Monitor **SQL\*Net round-trip time**.
* Evaluate **idle time vs. active time** in client-server interactions.
* Use tools like **AWR, ASH, and Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM)** to drill down.

### Summary

If you're seeing "notable network wait class" in a report or discussion:

* It's likely referring to **high-impact waits in the 'Network' wait class**.
* Investigate **SQL\*Net waits** and **RAC-related waits**.
* Compare against normal baselines to assess if they’re **notable**.

If you can provide the context (e.g., AWR snapshot or specific wait event), I can help analyze it further.
