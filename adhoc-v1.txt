Hi [Name],

As my last working day is nearing, I wanted to follow up regarding the retention process.

I had submitted my resignation on [date you submitted resignation], and during my conversation with [previous managerâ€™s name] at that time, he mentioned that he would initiate the retention process. I wanted to check if there has been any update on this from your end or if there are any next steps I should be aware of.

Please let me know in case you need any further details from my side.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
