Here is a **clear, practical sample data flow** for your **SQL Chat Application (React UI ↔️ Python FastAPI ↔️ SQL DB ↔️ React)**:

---

## 🛠️ **1️⃣ Components Recap**

* **Frontend:** React (chat UI)
* **Backend:** Python FastAPI service
* **DB:** Azure SQL / SQLite / PostgreSQL
* **LLM:** Azure OpenAI / Groq / Local LLM
* **Vector Store (optional):** FAISS/Qdrant for knowledge retrieval

---

## 🔄 **2️⃣ End-to-End Data Flow**

### **A. User sends a message from React UI**

* User types:

  > “Show my last 5 transactions for June.”

* React captures input and:

  * Adds session/user ID.
  * Optionally sets flags (e.g., `chart: true`).

* React sends a **POST request**:

```json
POST /chat
{
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "question": "Show my last 5 transactions for June.",
  "chart": true
}
```

---

### **B. Python FastAPI Receives Request**

* Extracts:

  * `user_id`
  * `question`
  * `chart`
* Retrieves:

  * **User conversation memory** (`user_123.jsonl` flat file).
  * **Knowledge context** from uploaded domain documents (optional RAG).
* Constructs a **prompt** for LLM:

  * Includes user question.
  * Includes context snippets (schema, domain knowledge).
  * Includes conversation history.

---

### **C. Python Calls LLM (Azure OpenAI)**

* Sends prompt to LLM:

  > “Generate a safe, parameterized SQL query to answer: ‘Show my last 5 transactions for June’ based on the context below…”

* LLM returns:

  ```sql
  SELECT date, description, amount FROM transactions 
  WHERE user_id = ? AND date BETWEEN '2023-06-01' AND '2023-06-30' 
  ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 5;
  ```

---

### **D. Python Executes SQL**

* Validates SQL:

  * Checks for disallowed keywords.
  * Confirms table and column names.
* Executes SQL on the database using parameterized queries.
* Fetches:

  * Rows (data).
  * Column names (schema).

---

### **E. Optional Chart Generation**

* If `chart: true`:

  * Generates a bar/line chart using Matplotlib/Plotly.
  * Encodes the chart as **base64** for easy transport.

---

### **F. Python Saves Conversation Memory**

* Appends:

  ```json
  {
    "user": "Show my last 5 transactions for June.",
    "assistant": {
      "sql": "...",
      "columns": ["date", "description", "amount"],
      "rows": [...],
      "chart_base64": "..."
    }
  }
  ```

  into `user_123.jsonl`.

---

### **G. Python Responds to React**

* Returns:

  ```json
  {
    "sql": "...",
    "columns": ["date", "description", "amount"],
    "rows": [["2023-06-29", "Grocery", "-250"], ...],
    "chart_base64": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA..."
  }
  ```

---

### **H. React Displays Response**

* Displays:

  * User question and assistant’s textual response.
  * A **table** with columns and rows.
  * If `chart_base64` exists:

    * Decodes and displays the chart inline.
* Adds the conversation to local chat history for continuity.

---

## 🗂️ **3️⃣ Visual Flow**

```
[User] → React Chat UI
        ↓ POST /chat
[FastAPI Python Service]
        ↓ Calls LLM for SQL
        ↓ Executes SQL
        ↓ Generates Chart (optional)
        ↓ Saves user memory
        ↓
[FastAPI Response]
        ↓
React Chat UI ← Displays Table, Chart, SQL (optional)
```

---

## 🛡️ **4️⃣ Security During Flow**

✅ TLS between React ↔️ FastAPI.
✅ Input validation and prompt injection sanitization.
✅ SQL validation before execution.
✅ Row-level security at DB level.
✅ Log request metadata for traceability.

---

## 🧩 **Optional Advanced Flow with Knowledge RAG**

* During step **B**, Python queries a vector store:

  * Embeds the user’s question.
  * Retrieves relevant domain knowledge chunks.
  * Appends these chunks to the LLM prompt for better SQL generation.

---

## 🚀 Summary

✅ **Simple, explainable flow:** User → React → FastAPI → LLM + DB → React.
✅ Handles **query generation, execution, summarization, and visualization**.
✅ Scalable to multi-user, multi-session environment with low coupling.
✅ Modular: React UI can be replaced with mobile or Teams bot, Python API remains the same.

If you want:
✅ A **sequence diagram** visually illustrating this flow for your documentation or slides.
✅ A **Postman collection** to test this flow end-to-end.
✅ A **matching React UI skeleton** for direct integration.
